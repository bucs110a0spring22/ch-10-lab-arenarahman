## SUMMARY:
 I completed part A in which my code moves the enemies on the screen by a rnadom value: -1,0, or 1. The enemies can kill the player or be killed by the player. For part B, I implemented a method that does not allow the hero to move off screen. 
 
#### Unique Feature
 My feature is that the hero does not move off screen when the player moves him. I made an update function in the hero class where it accounted for size of the screen, so taking the height and width of the screen, the player cannot move the hero further than those parameters.
